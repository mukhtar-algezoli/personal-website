title: GTA San Andereas Self-driving car
summary: This was a hobby project to learn and apply computer vision concepts, The idea is to control cars in games using python and then predict the next controller move using computer vision by reading pixels from the screen in real time! , and since Grand Theft Auto San Andereas is my favorite game I decided to use it as a proof of concept. I ended up recording the screen and finding Hough Lines using OpenCV which is then used as input to an AlexNet which predicts the next controller move (forward, back, right or left).
