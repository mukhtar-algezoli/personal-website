summary: This is my BSc graduation project, the first automatic Arabic text summarization system the produces both abstractive/Extractive summaries, using a pretrained autoencoder model called BERT with a transformer decoder fine-tuned in Arabic  news articles and its abstractive summaries as targets. The paper for this project is published as an ICLR 2020 paper.
