title: Samantha
summary: This was my first project trying to explore Language modeling back in 2020, I tried to make a conversational bot (mimicking Samantha from the famous film her). I borrowed a friends whatsapp conversations (with his GF), preprocessed this data and fine-tuned GPT-small on word prediction task, although samantha wasn't able to hold a conversation it sometimes gave interesting answers.
