title: Game Development
summary: I started with Game Development during my undergrads (2017-2019), during this time I learned a lot about modeling (Blender) and graphics rendering, Designing Software architectures in an optimized way, and how to handle real-time systems with real-time constraints. After gaining some experience I started designing Mulitplayer and  AR-supported Games.
