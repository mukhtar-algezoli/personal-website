title: Recommendation System
summary: This project was part of a E-commerce Bot Service from EngimaAI, The recommendation system uses a collaborative filtering approach where matching between users and items is done using a neural network based on users’ collaborative history. The training takes place using the history of items bought from the shop coupled with negative sampling to make the process suitable for mass production.

This project was part of a product developed, deployed, and maintained by our company (Enigma- AI), it’s called ”E-commerce Bots” providing a fully-fledged online shopping experience in Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram, or Twitter DM. To add more value to this autonomous system we implemented a deep learning recommendation system personalized for each user. The recommendation system uses a collaborative filtering approach where matching between users and items is done using a neural network based on users’ collaborative history. The training takes place using the history of items bought from the shop coupled with negative sampling to make the process suitable for mass production. this project is now a part of [Enigma Platform](https://platform.enigma-ai.com/).
